This repository is for training purposes as part of the **Meta SciFor** program. It contains various small and major projects developed during the training. You can check out demos of each project to explore the skills and techniques learned.

## Meta SciFor Training Program

The **Meta SciFor** training program provided in-depth learning and practical experience in Frontend development, covering front-end  deployment. Through this program, I worked on multiple projects, from mini-projects to a major project, building a Netflix clone with real-world functionality. The program not only honed my technical skills but also enabled collaboration, problem-solving, and version control experience using Git and GitHub.

### Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Tailwind CSS
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** React
- **API Integration:** OMDB API, PokeAPI, TMDB API (for learning purposes, note: banned in India)
- **Build Tools:** Vite
- **Deployment Platforms:** GitHub Pages, Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

Each project demonstrates different technical concepts and challenges tackled during the training program. The major project, the **Netflix Clone**, integrates a fully responsive UI, jQuery carousel, and Bootstrap for styling, with a view toward future improvements in React for dynamic data rendering.
